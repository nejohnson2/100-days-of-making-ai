    <p>
        <strong>100 Days of Making AI</strong> is a creative challenge by
        <a href="https://www.nejohnson2.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nicholas E. Johnson</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each day for 100 days, I spend 1.5 hours building an AI tool or project.
        The goal isn't perfection &mdash; it's practice. Each project is self-contained
        and completed within the session. What matters is showing up and making something.
    </p>
    <p>
        This site documents every project along the way. Click any tile on the
        <a href="{{ url_for('index') }}">home page</a> to read about that day's creation.
