    <p>
        <strong>100 Days of Making AI</strong> is a creative challenge by
        <a href="https://www.nejohnson2.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nicholas E. Johnson</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each day for 100 days, I spend time building an AI tool or project.
        The goal isn't perfection &mdash; it's practice. Each project is self-contained
        and completed within the session. What matters is showing up and making something.
    </p>
    <p>
        The projects vary widely in complexity and scope. Some are simple experiments,
        while others are more ambitious applications. The focus is on learning and
        exploring the capabilities of AI technologies.

    <p>This work is inspired by Katherine Dillon who teaches <a href="https://itp.nyu.edu/itp/100-days-of-making/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 Days of Making at NYU's ITP
        Program</a>.  Her <a href="https://itp.nyu.edu/adjacent/issue-1/reflections-on-my-100-days-of-making/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initial work</a> modifying
         Google Earth images to create stunning visual art was truly inspriational.
